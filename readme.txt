###Plugin Usage###

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The BBCode in my post is being replaced with &lt;pre&gt;'s just fine, but I don't see the syntax highlighting! =

Make sure your theme's footer has `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` somewhere in it, otherwise the JavaScript highlighting files won't be loaded.

= I still see the BBCode in my post. What gives? =

Make sure you correctly use the BBCode with a valid language attribute. A malformed usage of it won't result in replacement.

= Is this plugin licensed under GPL? =

Yes, like most plugins in the WordPress plugin directory, if not all. However the SyntaxHighligter javascript library is licensed under LGPLv3.

= Can I hide the toolbar, ruler, etc? =

Yes, you can give any of the options mentioned in http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter:Configuration#SyntaxHighlighter.defaults
as option attribute. See example bellow.

`[sourcecode language='css' option='toolbar: false;']code here[/sourcecode]`
